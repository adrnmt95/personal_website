                        <p>
                            I am an economist whose research lies at the intersection of political economy, causal inference, and machine learning. I use computational methods to investigate political accountability, conflict dynamics, and the behavior of organized crime.
                            I am currently completing my Ph.D. at Ca' Foscari University of Venice and will soon be joining ETH Zurich as a postdoctoral researcher in Professor Livia Schubiger's group at <a href="https://irds.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">IRDS</a>. When not running regressions, I can occasionally be found with a guitar in hand.

                                The 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1913, introduced direct elections for the U.S. Senate, substantially democratizing the existing system of indirect selection by U.S. state legislatures. This paper analyzes the impacts of this reform on measures of each senator's policy priorities constructed from the texts of their floor speeches and records of roll call votes. Using a difference-in-differences strategy comparing Senators with House Members (already directly elected) from the same state as the control group, we find that direct elections move Senators' policy agendas more closely to those associated with the House. The shift in priorities involves an increase in attention to fiscal policy and taxation and reduced attention to infrastructure and immigration, with an overall narrowing in the diversity of topics covered. Consistent with electoral retention motives as a mechanism, the effect is similar when limiting to incumbent Senators and including senator fixed effects. There is no effect of direct elections on the ideological slant of roll call votes, however, suggesting the effect on expressed agendas did not translate into direct effects on enacted policies.

                                This study uses a unique longitudinal data set on daily museum visits in Northern Italy to investigate how social networks influence leisure consumption. Based on detailed administrative records of museum cardholders, we use repeated joint visits to build a dynamic network of peers. We identify peer effects that exploit exogenous variation in membership prices generated by age-based discounts. We find robust evidence of peer spillovers in both museum attendance and membership renewal, primarily driven by a preference for shared experiences. These results underscore the role of social interactions in shaping leisure demand and support the view that social networks can amplify individual behavior. More broadly, our findings contribute to the understanding of peer dynamics in settings where consumption is inherently social.

                                This study investigates the impact of political shocks on extremist violence. It analyzes the aftermath of the December 2017 U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, treating the decision as a quasi-experimental shock. Using a staggered difference-in-differences methodology, the paper examines changes in violence comparing areas proximate to illegal Israeli outposts with those that are not. The findings reveal that the U.S. declaration triggered a sharp and significant increase in violence in areas near these outposts, where violent events rose by roughly 150\%. The analysis shows that incidents targeting civilians were particularly affected. The escalation of violence was asymmetrical; there was an immediate surge in violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers in the first years following the announcement. Conversely, a significant rise in violence from Palestinians emerged with a delay of nearly four years. These results suggest the diplomatic shock acted as a catalyst for radical behavior, initiating a self-perpetuating cycle of conflict in the West Bank. Further expansions will explore the role of domestic political dynamics in reaction to Trump's declaration.

                                This paper develops a novel early-warning system to predict firm confiscation due to mafia infiltration in Italy. We construct a dynamic, time-resolved corporate ownership network by tracing the first- and second-degree connections of all Italian firms confiscated between 2000 and 2024. Using this unique dataset, we train a series of machine learning models, combining firm-level financial data with a comprehensive set of network topology measures to forecast firm confiscation up to three years in advance. Our out-of-sample results demonstrate high predictive power, with the combined model achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of up to 0.975. We find that network features are crucial for achieving high recall, while firm-level financials provide higher precision. The integrated model effectively balances this trade-off, outperforming models that rely on either data source alone. A feature-contribution analysis using SHAP values reveals that firm size is the single most important predictor, with smaller and financially distressed firms facing higher confiscation risk. Network topology features also emerge as the second most important predictors. Taken together, our findings underscore the value of integrating ownership network intelligence with firm fundamentals to create a powerful and interpretable tool for risk-based supervision and enforcement against organized crime. Future work will leverage continuous-time dynamic graph networks to generate transferable firm embeddings, offering deeper insights into the latent nature of organized crime infiltration.
